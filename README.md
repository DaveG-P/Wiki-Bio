My name is David and I am an aspiring Data Artist.           
I love to merge data, research, and art to explore, learn, and understand how our beautiful world works.                      
I am currently working on many projects and deciding on which Graduate Schools to attend to earn an MSc. in Data Science.
So please stay tuned.

Thank you for checking out my GitHub. 

I hope you have an amazing day!

Sincerely, 


David
